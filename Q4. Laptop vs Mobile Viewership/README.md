I was to assume that I was given a table containing information on viewership by device type (where the three types are laptop, tablet, and phone). Define “mobile” as the sum of tablet and phone viewership numbers. 
### Task: 
Write a query to compare the viewership on laptops versus mobile devices. Output the total viewership for laptop and mobile devices in the format of "laptop_views" and "mobile_views".
